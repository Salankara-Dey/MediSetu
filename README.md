MediSetu – Smart Medicine Waste Reduction & Inventory Management System
🩺 Overview
MediSetu is an AI and IoT-powered healthcare solution designed to reduce medicine wastage and improve availability of temperature-sensitive drugs like vaccines, insulin, and biologics.
The system provides real-time inventory tracking, expiry alerts, and intelligent redistribution support for pharmacies and healthcare facilities.

🚨 Problem Statement
A large number of life-saving medicines expire in medical stores due to poor demand forecasting, lack of real-time inventory visibility, and uneven distribution.
At the same time, nearby pharmacies face shortages of the same medicines, leading to medical waste, higher costs, and reduced accessibility.

💡 Our Solution
MediSetu monitors medicine inventory, predicts demand, and sends automated expiry alerts while enabling timely redistribution of near-expiry medicines with cold-chain awareness.

✨ Key Features
📊 AI-based demand forecasting for medicines

⏰ Automated email alerts (2 months, 1 month, 7 days before expiry)

📁 CSV/Excel inventory upload system for pharmacies

🌡️ IoT-based temperature monitoring (cold-chain safety)

📦 Smart dashboard for stock, expiry, and risk tracking

🧠 AI & ML Integration
Simple demand forecasting model (JS-based logic / ML-ready)

Risk detection for near-expiry medicines

Smart alerts based on expiry timeline

Future scope: Predictive redistribution using ML models

(Current version uses rule-based + lightweight forecasting logic for fast deployment.)

📥 Inventory Management (CSV/Excel Upload)
Store owners can upload inventory files containing:

Medicine Name

Quantity

Expiry Date

Storage Type

Supported Formats:

.csv

.xlsx

The system automatically:

Reads inventory data

Detects near-expiry medicines

Updates dashboard analytics

📧 Email Alert System (Expiry Notifications)
Automated alerts are triggered:

60 days before expiry

30 days before expiry

7 days before expiry

Used Service: EmailJS
This helps pharmacy owners take timely action and reduce wastage.

🌡️ IoT Hardware Integration
We integrated IoT sensors to monitor refrigerator temperature for cold-chain medicines.
If temperature goes out of the safe range, the system flags high-risk stock.
